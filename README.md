# OpenQuest

OpenQuest is a platform that helps blockchain projects track, engage, and grow their communities through fun and interactive Quests.

## üöÄ The Problem OpenQuest Solves

Tokens are often misallocated to airdrop hunters, while projects struggle to drive genuine participation and sustainable growth in their ecosystems. Many projects also lack reliable ways to track contributor engagement, making it difficult to host provable and efficiently gated events like hackathons or grants.

OpenQuest solves this by enabling projects to:

- **Engage their communities**
- **Foster growth**
- **Reward meaningful contributions** through verifiable Quests.

With a leaderboard system, projects gain solid, verifiable metrics on contributors, helping protocols identify engagement trends and take action when contributors lose interest.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How OpenQuest Works

- **Personalized Account/Contracts:** Protocols register on OpenQuest, deploying dedicated smart contracts for seamless Quest management.
- **Permissionless & No-Code Deployment:** Launch customizable, verifiable Quests without approvals or coding.
- **Trustless Verification & Fair Scoring:** Powered by Cartesi‚Äôs Coprocessor for deterministic grading.
- **Automated Rewards & Incentive Pools:** Distribute rewards automatically based on participation and leaderboard rankings.
- **Leaderboard & Onchain Reputation:** Track developer contributions and community engagement, with NFTs as proof of participation.

---

## üîÆ Future Implementations

- AI integration for meme and technical writing contests.
- Hackathon support with improved interface and flow.
- Social scanner integration for content creator rewards.

## üß∞ Technologies Used

Cartesi, EigenLayer, Next.js, Rust, Actix-web, Solidity

## Running Locally:

### Starting the Backend:

- CD into server directory, create a .env file with the necessary values mentioned in the .env.example file.
- CD out and into the contracts directory, create another .env file with the details found in the .env.example file of the contracts dir.
- CD into the Coprocessor Directory, using the cartesi-coprocessor cli, run the start devnet command then publish the program to devnet:

  ```bash
  cartesi-coprocessor start-devnet
  ```

  ```bash
  cartesi-coprocessor pubish --network devnet
  ```

- Copy the machine hash gotten after publishing the coprocessor program, cd into the contracts directory and modify the .env file with the machine hash.
- While in the contracts folder run the command below to Deploy the Protocol Factory contract:

  ```bash
    forge script script/DeployFactory.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --broadcast --private-key <Private key to deploy the factory>
  ```

  **Note:** The private key passed in the command above should be the same passed in the .env files to avoid reverts due to contract ownership.

- Copy the address of the protocol factory gotten from the previous command then navigate to the server directory and modify the env with the new protocol factory address (OPENQUEST_FACTORY)
- Start your server by running the following command:
  ```bash
  cargo run
  ```
  **Note:** If you experience permission issue running the `cargo run` command, you can run this instead to fix that: `sudo cargo run`.
