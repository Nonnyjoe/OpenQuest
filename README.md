# OpenQuest

OpenQuest is a platform that helps blockchain projects track, engage, and grow their communities through fun and interactive Quests.

## üöÄ The Problem OpenQuest Solves

Tokens are often misallocated to airdrop hunters, while projects struggle to drive genuine participation and sustainable growth in their ecosystems. Many projects also lack reliable ways to track contributor engagement, making it difficult to host provable and efficiently gated events like hackathons or grants.

OpenQuest solves this by enabling projects to:

- **Engage their communities**
- **Foster growth**
- **Reward meaningful contributions** through verifiable Quests.

With a leaderboard system, projects gain solid, verifiable metrics on contributors, helping protocols identify engagement trends and take action when contributors lose interest.
